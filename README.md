# Robot_SLAM_Simulation
SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) is a method used for autonomous vehicles that lets you build a map and localize your vehicle in that map at the same time. SLAM algorithms allow the vehicle to map out unknown environments. Engineers use the map information to carry out tasks such as path planning and obstacle avoidance.
_____________________________________________

Unit A: Use a motion model to determine the robot's trajectory, analyze lidar scans to find the cylinder positions.
-
Run slam_02_b_filter_motor_file_question.py and and slam_03_d_find_cylinders_cartesian_question.py to generate the necessary text files. 

Then run logfile_viewer.py and load text files to view the robot's calculated path, the reference path, the lidar scans, the scanned locations of the cylinders, and the real locations of the cylinders.
