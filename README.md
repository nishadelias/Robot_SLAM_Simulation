# Robot_SLAM_Simulation
SLAM: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
_____________________________________________

Unit A: Use a motion model to determine the robot's trajectory, analyze lidar scans to find the cylinder positions.

Run slam_02_b_filter_motor_file_question.py and and slam_03_d_find_cylinders_cartesian_question.py to generate the necessary text files. Then run logfile_viewer.py and load text files to view the robot's path based on measurements, the reference path, the lidar scans, the scanned locations of the cylinders, and the real locations of the cylinders.

Unit B: Using sensor data to improve the robot's state.

Unit C: Filtering.

Unit D: The Kalman Filter.

Unit E: The Particle Filter.

Unit F: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping.

Unit F: Particle Filter SLAM (FastSLAM).
