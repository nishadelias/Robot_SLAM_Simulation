# Robot SLAM Simulation
SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) is a method used for autonomous vehicles that lets you build a map and localize your vehicle in that map at the same time. SLAM algorithms allow the vehicle to map out unknown environments. Engineers use the map information to carry out tasks such as path planning and obstacle avoidance.

In this project, the data was recorded by a small robot which drove through an arena with some cylinders in it. The only data we have to build our SLAM simulation is the left and right wheel ticks and the LIDAR scans of the arena. There are also text files included which show the true position of the robot and the cylinders, which was recorded by an overhead camera. This allows us to compare our estimates to the true positions.
_____________________________________________

Unit A: Use a motion model to determine the robot's trajectory, analyze lidar scans to find the cylinder positions.
-
Run slam_02_b_filter_motor_file_question.py and and slam_03_d_find_cylinders_cartesian_question.py to generate the necessary text files. 

Then run logfile_viewer.py and load text files to view the robot's calculated path, the reference path, the lidar scans, the scanned locations of the cylinders, and the real locations of the cylinders.
