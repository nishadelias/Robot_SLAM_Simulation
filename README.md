# Robot_SLAM_Simulation
SLAM: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping

Unit A: Use a motion model to determine the robot's trajectory, analyze lidar scans to find the cylinder positions.

Unit B: Using sensor data to improve the robot's state.

Unit C: Filtering.

Unit D: The Kalman Filter.

Unit E: The Particle Filter.

Unit F: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping.

Unit F: Particle Filter SLAM (FastSLAM).
